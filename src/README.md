# Introduction

<p class="subheadline">
    A UI framework with no UI
</p>

This is the official docs for [Iridium](https://github.com/iridiumui/iridium). You can browse all the relevant sections in the sidebar. If you are on mobile it will be in the navigation. 

As the docs are meant to be used as a reference it's highly encouraged that you utilise the search features. On any page, you can press 's' or '/' to quickly move focus into the search bar.

It should also be noted that Iridium is still in the very early stages and is currently under active development. This means that there will most likely be breaking changes. It also means that there are likely to be some missing features. Lastly, there are some things which haven't been tested thoroughly. This is especially regarding accessibility and cross-browser compatibility.
