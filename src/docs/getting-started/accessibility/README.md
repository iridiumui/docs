# Accessibility

One of the goals of Iridium is making accessibility easier.

Currently Iridium is in the very early stages. That means there haven't been a lot of focus on accessibility yet. That's gonna change though.

Inspiration will be taken from resources such as [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/) and [Reach UI](https://ui.reach.tech/).

Any help and knowledge on this topic is very welcome
