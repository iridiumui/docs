# Screen XL

The Screen XL component is an abstraction of the [Breakpoint](../) component. 

It can be used to display content on any screen sizes larger than `1200px`.

## Examples
<CodeBlock>
```html
<template>
    <screen-xl>
        <p>This text is only visible on extra large screens</p>
    </screen-xl>
</template>
```
</CodeBlock>
